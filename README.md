Swift 4.2 + Cocoapods 

Some Future Improvements in mind: 

- Move to Swift 5.1 
- Use SwiftUI to replace XIBs 
- Use Combine Framework to abstract communication pattern 
- Add Snapshot Testing to do UI testing 
- Use less Cocoapods with SwiftUI implementations 

In the time of developing this demo, I am in progress of learning SwiftUI + Combine framework, but to show my understanding of good coding practice, I decided to use what I am the most familiar with first. In addition, the approach of creating UI which I have taken is inspired by the design patterns that is abstracted by SwiftUI. Whilst communication pattern by Notification events and reading variables by function is inspired by and merely my own implementation of the Reactive Programming pattern which vastly simplified from the appraoch of Delegate protocol initially promoted by Apple documentation.
